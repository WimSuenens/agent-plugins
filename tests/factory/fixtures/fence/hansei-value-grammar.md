### Value grammar

Every value slot (`<dur>`, `<n>`, `<fpy>`, `<tok>`, a version, a hash) holds exactly one of:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| a measured value | as defined per field below |
| `0` (or `0m`) | measured, and truly zero |
| `n/a (did not run)` | the stage or role did not run on this item. Allowed only in measures 2 and 5, and only for a stage or role that did not run. |
| `not captured (<reason>)` | you could not observe it. The reason is short and always present. |
| `pending resurvey` | measure 7 only, between posting and the resurvey edit |

**Honesty rule**: an uncaptured value is never `0`, never blank, never dropped. The line stays in its place. `n/a` never stands in for `not captured`.

Formats:

- `<dur>`: whole minutes, rounded to the nearest minute, as `<h>h<mm>m` from one hour (`3h07m`) or `<m>m` below it (`42m`, `0m`).
- `<n>`: a plain integer, no separators.
- `<fpy>`: `pass first time` | `pass first time (<n> low)` | `failed first time` | `n/a (did not run)` | `not captured (<reason>)`.
- `<tok>`: `<total> (input <i>, cache write <w>, cache read <r>, output <o>)`, plain integers, `total = i + w + r + o` (this is the `spend …` part of `token-spend.sh`'s line, verbatim). Or `n/a (did not run)` / `not captured (<reason>)` for the whole slot.
- Times anywhere in the record: UTC, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ`.
